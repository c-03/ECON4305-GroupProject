# ECON4305-GroupProject
ECON 4305 is a course in HKUST, focused on Applied Machine Learning for Economic and Financial Analysis. This course's group project was applied as my final year project. This repository contains materials from my group project, including raw data, Python scripts for data analysis, and the final term paper.
