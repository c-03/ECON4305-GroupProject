# ECON4305-GroupProject
ECON 4305 is a course in HKUST, focused on Applied Machine Learning for Economic and Financial Analysis. This course's group project was applied as my final year project. This repository contains materials from my group project, including raw data, Python scripts for data analysis, and the final term paper demonstrating the methodologies behind the topic: Forecasting US Interest Rate. Our study utilised the below methodologies:

- Dimensionality Reduction Methods: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Recursive Factor Elimination (RFE), SelectKBest with and without Sliding Time Window
- Classification Models: Logistic Regressions, Decision Tree Regression, Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) Classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) Classifier with and without Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) [In order to tackle the class imbalance issue)
- Prediction Models: Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

Authors: This project was completed by Alan (me), Sky, Berton and Gurjot as part of the ECON 4305 course at HKUST.
